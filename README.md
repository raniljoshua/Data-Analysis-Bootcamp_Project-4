# Consumer Credit Analytical Model

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a robust analytical model capable of understanding the dynamics of consumer credit. We aim to investigate historical trends in consumer credit from June 2000 through December 2022 and utilize this data to predict future patterns up to December 2023. Through meticulous data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and advanced predictive modeling techniques, we intend to offer valuable insights into the factors driving changes in consumer credit levels. By focusing on several key variables, such as interest rates, election cycles, and unemployment rates, we will determine their correlation and impact on consumer credit behavior. This analysis will not only allow us to predict the 'Total Consumer Credit' with a significant degree of accuracy but will also enable financial institutions to make informed decisions regarding credit risk management and policy development. By achieving our goal of a minimum of 0.80 R-squared value, we will ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our predictive model, providing a dependable tool for economic analysts and decision-makers.
